East Maxwell Street is just one street around the now-destroyed Adamstown community, a historically African-American community around the block of Rose St., Ave. of Champions, Martin Luther King Blvd. and Maxwell St. Since the majority of the properties in Adamstown were bought up by the University of Kentucky in the mid-20th century, a mjority of the residences were destroyed for the contruction of Memorial Colleseum and the parking accomodations behind it. East Maxwell St. is the only portion of the block that still holds many of the original structures form this historic neighborhood. By charting the residents of East Maxwell St. throughout the 20th century through its destruction, the changes in how spaces were used on this section of the block will be visualized as the University of Kentucky grew larger and larger.
